      <description>by Edward De Brouwer and Giulia Lazzara
The Halting Problem (Informal) Statement Given an input, any machine either processes that input in a finite amount of time (it halts), or runs forever in an infinite loop. The halting problem asks whether it is possible to create a machine that, given any other machine and its input, can determine whether that machine will eventually halt, or not.

(Informal) Proof Let $M$ be the set of all possible machines, and $X$ the space of program inputs.</description>

      <description>The fridge odyssey is an introspection of modernity through the lens of one of its most important landmark: the refrigerator. The lonely fridge of 124, Avenue de l&amp;rsquo;Hippodrome used Edward De Brouwer and Gauthier Fievet as new Moses to transcribe its hare-brained ideas into thermodynamical soundtracks.
We won&#39;t be your frigo Modernity promise of progress is outdated. With no compass to rely on, we have to start challengin our relation to domination.</description>

      <title>On the parts of the soul</title>

      <description>Introduction Despite the immense diversity of life forms that populate our universe, living organisms have a tautological point in common: life. Nevertheless, within a single organism, life can manifest itself in different ways or capacities and increasing levels of complexity. In this essay, we study excerpt 413b 10-20 from the second chapter of the second book of De Anima1 and analyze how Aristotle unifies different life capacities under a unique principle: the soul.</description>

      <title>The ideological roots of colonialism</title>

      <description>Introduction Colonialism is not accidental. It is the consequence of a specific conception of the world that was supported by western thought. In this essay, we motivate this assumption and show that it entails stronger requirements for reparation than the ones advocated for by proponents of structural injustices such as Catherine Lu1. Furthermore, we illustrate our argument by articulating climate injustices as an ongoing case of colonialism.
Structural injustice The importance of the social environment in the decision process of human beings has been assessed since the works of Emile Durkheim2 and further reinforced ever since.</description>

      <title>Material reparation in colonialism: a counterfactual perspective</title>

      <description>Good things come in three. A critique of the doubly counterfactual approach. In Repairing Historical Wrongs and the End of Empire1, Butt discusses the claims that some contemporary states have duties to pay compensations for the lasting effects of colonialism. Many types of reparations can be considered in the context of colonialism. Yet, the author, while acknowledging the importance of a multifaceted approach, chooses to focus on the compensatory redistribution of resources2.</description>

      <title>Morality and empathy in multi-species societies</title>

      <description>Morality and empathy in multi-species societies.
In his Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals, David Hume describes morality as driven by a sentiment of natural philanthropy that would eventually maximize the utility of the society. In this essay, we first summarize this important moral principle as developed by Hume, and then show that this sentiment that connects us to social utility is related to the notion of empathy and thus shares its limits.</description>

      <description>The labyrinth is a poem generator we designed with Giulia Lazzara during a stay in Athens in 2020. It&amp;rsquo;s a two player games whose rules are defined by the environment.
Des méandres. Un chemin. Enchevêtrement de trajectoires linéaires résultant en une topologie planaire. Se chercher, se fuir. S’abriter, explorer. Tentative de sortie. Et la rassurante conclusion de son impossibilité. Et cette impression d’ensemble, juxtaposition des sens. Sens de la culture. Interprétation systématique.</description>

      <title>Topological Graph Neural Networks</title>

      <description>Graph neural networks (GNNs) are a powerful architecture for tackling graph learning tasks, yet have been shown to be oblivious to eminent substructures such as cycles. We present TOGL, a novel layer that incorporates global topological information of a graph using persistent homology. TOGL can be easily integrated into any type of GNN and is strictly more expressive in terms of the Weisfeiler-Lehman graph isomorphism test. Augmenting GNNs with our layer leads to improved predictive performance for graph and node classification tasks, both on synthetic data sets (which can be classified by humans using their topology but not by ordinary GNNs) and on real-world data.</description>

      <title>A comparison of Hegel’s and Leibniz’ theodicies</title>

      <description>Hegel compares his approach to world history to a theodicy and more specifically to Leibniz’s Theodicy: Essays on the Goodness of God, the Freedom of Man and the Origin of Evil (1710) (p. 45). What are the similarities and differences between Hegel’s approach to world history and this work by Leibniz?
In his lectures on the philosophy of world history, Hegel explicitly refers to his approach of world history as a theodicy1.</description>

      <title>A natural selection account of the evolution of knowledge</title>

      <description>Insights from Nietzsche and Darwin In “The Gay Science”1, Friedrich Nietzsche delivers a narrative of the origin of knowledge. In this short essay, we show that Nietzsche’s account is evolutionary2 in the Darwinian sense.
In the “Origin of species”3, Darwin proposed a true cause4 for the origin and evolution of species. The three main ingredients of this theory consist of a pressure of selection, a source of variation among individuals of the same species, and a mechanism for inheritance of traits.</description>

      <title>Continuous modeling of sporadically-observed time series</title>
      <link>http://edebrouwer.github.io/machine-learning/gruode/</link>

      <description>Modeling real-world multidimensional time series can be particularly challenging when these are sporadically observed (ie, sampling is irregular both in time and across dimensions)—such as in the case of clinical patient data. To address these challenges, we propose (1) a continuous-time version of the Gated Recurrent Unit, building upon the recent Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Chen et al., 2018), and (2) a Bayesian update network that processes the sporadic observations. We bring these two ideas together in our GRU-ODE-Bayes method.</description>

      <description>Recommendation systems from a philosophical and anthropological perspective: insights from Sartre and Heidegger. Introduction. Recommendation systems, as automated information systems aiming at providing recommendations to users with content they might appreciate, are now an integral part of our modern society. Social media, entertainment systems, news or advertising all actively use such automated systems to provide personalized content. Importantly, recommender systems have benefited from the rapid progress of machine learning to improve their performance and their personalization, allowing these systems to rely on data alone rather than on human-specified rules.</description>

      <description>I am a Senior Machine Learning Scientist at Genentech, San Francisco, USA.
My machine learning interests revolve around time series, graphs, and geometry with applications in biology and healthcare. My main focus relies on developing robust and interpretable methods that can improve the cooperation between humans and AI. I&amp;rsquo;m studying this interaction from a computational and philosophical perspective.
Before Genentech, I was a postdoctoral associate at Yale University with Smita Krishnaswamy.</description>
