In this short essay, we show that Nietzsche’s account is evolutionary2 in the Darwinian sense.\nIn the “Origin of species”3, Darwin proposed a true cause4 for the origin and evolution of species. The three main ingredients of this theory consist of a pressure of selection, a source of variation among individuals of the same species, and a mechanism for inheritance of traits. The pressure of selection was influenced by the work of Malthus on demographic stress, suggesting that individuals have to fight for survival5. The variations among a particular species and the capacity to inherit traits across generations were drawn from Darwin’s extensive observation of the natural world6. The true cause of evolution as proposed by Darwin is then the natural selection: submitted to an external stress (survival in the natural world), individuals are selected by their fitness to their environment. The survivors subsequently reproduce and pass on their advantageous traits to their descendance. Over the course of multiple generations, this leads to an evolution of the species where advantageous traits become more dominant and disadvantageous ones less so, potentially to extinction.\nIn his “Origins of knowledge”7, Nietzsche clearly refers to the principle of natural selection. The products of the intellect can be identified as the individual’s traits, with the thinker being the organism expressing those traits. As for the ingredients of natural selection, the diversity and the inheritance of products of the intellect are recognized by Nieztche the same way as Darwin. Namely, he posits, without explaining, the existence of such mechanisms by observing that a diversity of ideas exist and that those are inherited through generations in human society8. Nietzsche also directly refers to a force of selection, an environmental stress, which is survival (life): “some of them [products of the intellect] turned out to be useful and species-preserving”9. Nieztsche therefore lays out all the components of a natural selection mechanism at the level of products of the intellect.\nNow, let’s examine the evolution of the products of the intellect in the framework of Nietzsche. Initially only errors10 were produced. The ones that were giving a competitive advantage survived to eventually consolidate into the “basic endowment”11 of the species. Through the diversity of the generation of ideas, but “very late”12, truth eventually emerged. However, these instances of truths were not providing a direct competitive advantage and were thus not naturally selected. Similarly as genes have to work together to produce a well functioning organism, ideas also need to be coherently organized. For this reason, truths initially set up where cohabitation with previous errors was possible and gradually took hold in more territory of the mind13, to eventually become a life-preserving power14. Two serious competing powers are thus now competing on the battlefield of ideas. But as our own future biological evolution as a species is uncertain, the way this balance of powers will be settled is an experiment whose outcome only time will tell15.\nBibliography  Ruse, Michael. “Charles Darwin.” In Philosophy of Biology, North-Holland, 2007.

<p>In “The Gay Science”<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup>, Friedrich Nietzsche delivers a narrative of the origin of knowledge. In this short essay, we show that Nietzsche’s account is evolutionary<sup id=fnref:2><a href=#fn:2 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>2</a></sup> in the Darwinian sense.</p>
<p>In the “Origin of species”<sup id=fnref:3><a href=#fn:3 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>3</a></sup>, Darwin proposed a true cause<sup id=fnref:4><a href=#fn:4 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>4</a></sup> for the origin and evolution of species. The three main ingredients of this theory consist of a pressure of selection, a source of variation among individuals of the same species, and a mechanism for inheritance of traits. The pressure of selection was influenced by the work of Malthus on demographic stress, suggesting that individuals have to fight for survival<sup id=fnref:5><a href=#fn:5 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>5</a></sup>.
