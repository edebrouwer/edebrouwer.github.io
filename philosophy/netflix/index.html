Introduction. Recommendation systems, as automated information systems aiming at providing recommendations to users with content they might appreciate, are now an integral part of our modern society. Social media, entertainment systems, news or advertising all actively use such automated systems to provide personalized content. Importantly, recommender systems have benefited from the rapid progress of machine learning to improve their performance and their personalization, allowing these systems to rely on data alone rather than on human-specified rules. However, recent evidence has shown that such systems, taught to maximize engagement, have managed to outsmart their designers by actively manipulating the preference of users. If the end goal of the recommendation system seems to be met, namely having users engaging with the content providing platform, this manipulation of the users tastes surely raises questions on the ethical and philosophical level. In this essay, we address the question of recommendation systems from a philosophical and anthropological perspective. We focus our study on two major thinkers of the human being, namely Jean-Paul Sartre and Martin Heidegger. Based on their account of the human being, we analyze how the recommender systems do or do not match with humanity. Are recommendation systems dehumanizing?\nRecommendation Systems. In their simplest form, recommendation systems consist of a piece of software that suggests personalized recommendations to individual users of a content providing platform. Ultimately, the purpose of such systems is to generate engagement or activity. The rationale is that if users are recommended content they appreciate, it should lead to an increased usage of the platform1. A movie streaming platform that recommends users with movies they might like is an illustrative example. The platform there consists of a catalog of movies, an infrastructure to stream the content and the recommendation system itself. Importantly, the most recent and vast majority of recommendation systems are data-driven2. That is, they learn how to produce good recommendations from available data rather than using human-designed rules. The available data consists of previous ratings or engagement metrics from other users as well as the target user’s history. The predictions are therefore dynamic, the recommendations evolving dynamically with the user’s content consumption. Crucially, because the pertinence of future recommendations will depend on current ones, this leads to a feedback loop between the user and the platform3. The systems can therefore abuse this feedback loop to manipulate the preference of users and generate more engagement4. This shift in user’s preference is unconscious but results in an amplification of the homogenisation of user’s behavior and taste, with a stronger effect observed for users belonging to minority groups5. Despite recent efforts to address this effect, it is now recognized that this preference shift is unavoidable due to the feedback loop that is intrinsic to the concept of recommendation system. Because of this ability and their wide use, these systems are tools of digital mass persuasion that could be used for the better or for the worst6. Yet, regardless of the content, this vulnerability potentially contradicts concepts of our notion of humanity7.\nExistentialist perspective: insights from Sartre. In his conference L’existentialisme est un humanisme8, Jean-Paul Sartre explicitly rejects the idea of a human essence towards which humans should tend9. Rather, Sartre asserts the indeterminacy of human beings, and considers them to be absolutely free. The exercise of this freedom, through conscious choices and acts, is constitutive of the human condition. Indeed, Sartre states that what distinguishes human beings from other beings is that they are always outside of themselves, in perpetual construction. Man is never in complete overlap with itself (outside of itself), it is what it is not and not what it is10. This impetus forward, this force of transcendence11 is constitutive of man. And this transcendance manifests itself by taking concrete actions and decisions with one’s own life12. By humanism, Sartre understands a concept of man that “has no other legislator than himself […] and it’s by looking outside of himself a goal that is such a liberation, such a particular realization that man realizes himself as human”13. Now, is this vision of human beings compatible with the conditions imposed by the recommendation systems?\nThe lack of conscious choice prevents humans from consciously constructing themselves. Despite the apparent choices that those systems offer, these can be cast as false choices. All pre-selected items to choose from eventually converge towards the same uniformised preference profile14. Rather than constructive, those apparent choices therefore contribute to forging an identity that complies with a predefined standard or essence. Human beings are therefore not outside of themselves anymore but rather already enrolled in a fixed deterministic dynamic that threatens them to be reduced to simple beings. What is more, we argue that the decisions we make in those systems are not bound to the consumption of a particular item but rather have an impact on the construction of an individual as a whole. Indeed, again from an existentialist perspective, the books, movies, or news that we ingest contribute to defining ourselves.\nNevertheless, the choice to subscribe to these platforms using recommendation systems is constructive even if opting out becomes increasingly difficult. Choosing to comply with recommendation systems therefore might become the most important decision from an existentialist point of view: choosing to renounce choice or to embrace it.\nInsights from Heidegger.\nAccording to Heidegger, the existential humanism defended by Sartre failed to break free from the traditional metaphysics take on humanism15. According to Heidegger, Sartre’s vision is anthropocentric and fails to address the fundamental question of Being16. To Heidegger, human beings are world-forming17. The world, defined as the manifestness of beings as such as a whole18, is formed by the Dasein of human beings. This manifestness of beings underlies a fundamental distinction in Heidegger between Being and beings. This ontological difference19 emphasises the way beings manifest themselves to human beings. The world is then this manifestness of beings created by the human mind. Importantly for our inquiry, this ontological vision of human beings cannot be challenged by the recommendation systems in a direct way. Indeed, world formation is an intrinsic phenomenon that precedes any logical analysis of the world20. We therefore argue that this phenomenon can’t be affected by an alienation of true choices.\nHowever, according to Heidegger, the world formation arises from a primordial structure: the projection2122. “Projecting unveils the Being of beings”23 and therefore allows humans to tell the ontological difference, and to see beings under different types of Being. Remarkably, in his discussion of projection, Heidegger puts forward essential aspects of human beings that bear strong similarities with Sartre’s existentialism. He emphasises the prefix “pro-” (“Ent-”) to state that it “carries out and away from oneself”24, which resonates with Sarte’s account of man being outside of himself. Heidegger also describes human beings as being essentially away, in a constant self-construction25. In that regard, the analysis of recommendation systems in the light of Sartre’s existentialism remains valid. Namely, the uniformisation and false choices embedded in these systems prevent humans from constructing themselves. This permanent leap forward that characterizes human beings is frozen in a static human condition.\nConclusion Sartre and Heidegger, despite their disagreements, share similarities. In particular, the emphasis of the condition of man being outside of himself, in constant construction, is present in both authors. For Sartre, it is represented by the neantisation of consciousness (“being what I’m not”). For Heidegger, it is described as a projection. For both authors, those characteristics are essential in man. However, we argued that recommendation systems, through the alienation of freedom26 and the irresistible convergence to a uniform profile of preference (uniformisation), are hurdles in the realization of this vision of the human condition. When interacting with the platform, human beings therefore renounce some autonomy and agree to be shaped by a third party rather than by themselves. Nevertheless, we identified that subscribing to these platforms is a choice, probably the crucial and defining one.\nIn this essay, we attempted to analyze how a particular piece of technology can conform with visions of human beings laid out in the first half of the twentieth century. Yet, this vision is certainly not the ultimate one and the development of new technology has the potential to always challenge our understanding of ourselves as a species. Just as the recommendation systems and the users find themself in an inextricable feedback loop, so does humanity with technology as a whole. Humans create technology that, in turn, challenges the representation of themselves. In that sense, asking the question of if a technology is dehumanizing will always be one move behind, as that technology will already have shaped us differently than what we take as a reference to ask the question.\nBibliography.xz Chaney, Allison JB, Brandon M.

This impetus forward, this force of transcendence<sup id=fnref:11><a href=#fn:11 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>11</a></sup> is constitutive of man. And this transcendance manifests itself by taking concrete actions and decisions with one’s own life<sup id=fnref:12><a href=#fn:12 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>12</a></sup>. By humanism, Sartre understands a concept of man that “has no other legislator than himself [&mldr;] and it’s by looking outside of himself a goal that is such a liberation, such a particular realization that man realizes himself as human”<sup id=fnref:13><a href=#fn:13 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>13</a></sup>. Now, is this vision of human beings compatible with the conditions imposed by the recommendation systems?</p><p>The lack of conscious choice prevents humans from consciously constructing themselves. Despite the apparent choices that those systems offer, these can be cast as false choices. All pre-selected items to choose from eventually converge towards the same uniformised preference profile<sup id=fnref:14><a href=#fn:14 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>14</a></sup>. Rather than constructive, those apparent choices therefore contribute to forging an identity that complies with a predefined standard or essence. Human beings are therefore not outside of themselves anymore but rather already enrolled in a fixed deterministic dynamic that threatens them to be reduced to simple beings. What is more, we argue that the decisions we make in those systems are not bound to the consumption of a particular item but rather have an impact on the construction of an individual as a whole. Indeed, again from an existentialist perspective, the books, movies, or news that we ingest contribute to defining ourselves.</p><p>Nevertheless, the choice to subscribe to these platforms using recommendation systems is constructive even if opting out becomes increasingly difficult. Choosing to comply with recommendation systems therefore might become the most important decision from an existentialist point of view: choosing to renounce choice or to embrace it.</p><p><strong>Insights from Heidegger.</strong></p><p>According to Heidegger, the existential humanism defended by Sartre failed to break free from the traditional metaphysics take on humanism<sup id=fnref:15><a href=#fn:15 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>15</a></sup>. According to Heidegger, Sartre’s vision is anthropocentric and fails to address the fundamental question of Being<sup id=fnref:16><a href=#fn:16 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>16</a></sup>. To Heidegger, human beings are <em>world-forming</em><sup id=fnref:17><a href=#fn:17 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>17</a></sup>. The world, defined as the <em>manifestness of beings as such as a whole</em><sup id=fnref:18><a href=#fn:18 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>18</a></sup>, is formed by the Dasein of human beings. This manifestness of beings underlies a fundamental distinction in Heidegger between <em>Being</em> and <em>beings</em>. This ontological difference<sup id=fnref:19><a href=#fn:19 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>19</a></sup> emphasises the way beings manifest themselves to human beings. The world is then this manifestness of beings created by the human mind. Importantly for our inquiry, this ontological vision of human beings cannot be challenged by the recommendation systems in a direct way. Indeed, world formation is an intrinsic phenomenon that precedes any logical analysis of the world<sup id=fnref:20><a href=#fn:20 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>20</a></sup>. We therefore argue that this phenomenon can’t be affected by an alienation of true choices.</p><p>However, according to Heidegger, the world formation arises from a primordial structure: the <em>projection</em><sup id=fnref:21><a href=#fn:21 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>21</a></sup><sup id=fnref:22><a href=#fn:22 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>22</a></sup>. “Projecting unveils the Being of beings”<sup id=fnref:23><a href=#fn:23 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>23</a></sup> and therefore allows humans to tell the ontological difference, and to see beings under different types of Being. Remarkably, in his discussion of projection, Heidegger puts forward essential aspects of human beings that bear strong similarities with Sartre’s existentialism. He emphasises the prefix “pro-” (“Ent-”) to state that it “carries out and away from oneself”<sup id=fnref:24><a href=#fn:24 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>24</a></sup>, which resonates with Sarte’s account of man being outside of himself. Heidegger also describes human beings as being <em>essentially</em> <em>away</em>, in a constant self-construction<sup id=fnref:25><a href=#fn:25 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>25</a></sup>. In that regard, the analysis of recommendation systems in the light of Sartre’s existentialism remains valid. Namely, the uniformisation and false choices embedded in these systems prevent humans from constructing themselves. This permanent leap forward that characterizes human beings is frozen in a static human condition.</p><h4 id=conclusion>Conclusion<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#conclusion>#</a></h4><p>Sartre and Heidegger, despite their disagreements, share similarities. In particular, the emphasis of the condition of man being outside of himself, in constant construction, is present in both authors. For Sartre, it is represented by the neantisation of consciousness (“being what I’m not”). For Heidegger, it is described as a projection. For both authors, those characteristics are essential in man. However, we argued that recommendation systems, through the alienation of freedom<sup id=fnref:26><a href=#fn:26 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>26</a></sup> and the irresistible convergence to a uniform profile of preference (uniformisation), are hurdles in the realization of this vision of the human condition. When interacting with the platform, human beings therefore renounce some autonomy and agree to be shaped by a third party rather than by themselves. Nevertheless, we identified that subscribing to these platforms is a choice, probably the crucial and defining one.</p><p>In this essay, we attempted to analyze how a particular piece of technology can conform with visions of human beings laid out in the first half of the twentieth century. Yet, this vision is certainly not the ultimate one and the development of new technology has the potential to always challenge our understanding of ourselves as a species. Just as the recommendation systems and the users find themself in an inextricable feedback loop, so does humanity with technology as a whole. Humans create technology that, in turn, challenges the representation of themselves. In that sense, asking the question of if a technology is dehumanizing will always be one move behind, as that technology will already have shaped us differently than what we take as a reference to ask the question.</p><h3 id=bibliographyxz>Bibliography.xz<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#bibliographyxz>#</a></h3><p>Chaney, Allison JB, Brandon M.
