Hegel compares his approach to world history to a theodicy and more specifically to Leibniz’s _Theodicy: Essays on the Goodness of God, the Freedom of Man and the Origin of Evil_ (1710) (p. 45). What are the similarities and differences between Hegel’s approach to world history and this work by Leibniz?


In his lectures on the philosophy of world history, Hegel explicitly refers to his approach of world history as a theodicy[^1]. In particular, he compares his endeavor with the anterior attempt of Leibniz. In this short essay, we provide a comparison of theodicies from Hegel and Leibniz.

The term theodicy finds its origins in the eponym work of Leibniz[^2]. Literally meaning the “judgement of god”[^3], a theodicy can be generally understood as an argument to address the problem of evil. That is, how can we reconcile the seemingly contradictory concepts of evil and of an omnipotent and benevolent God? An omnipotent God would seeminlgy not create an imperfect world (the underachiever problem) and a God involved in all, and potentially evil, actions would not be exactly holy (the holiness problem). As a solution to the first problem, Leibniz proposes that our world is actually "the best of all worlds"[^4], refuting the arguments against this statement based on particular cases. The superlative also implies a criterion for judging the goodness of the world. Leibniz discusses several criteria, among which the maximization of the essence[^5]. With respect to the holiness problem, Leibniz argues that evil is _necessary_ in the creation of this best world, with God having a permissive stance towards evil doings.

Over a hundred years after Leibniz, Hegel also interprets his philosophy of world history as an attempt to make sense of the presence of evil. A central notion in Hegel’s work is the spirit. The spirit, which bears similarities with the concept of the soul is an immaterial[^6] entity, capable of thought, self-sufficient and free[^7]. It can take several forms or inhabit different material entities such as human beings, a nation or the world (weltgeist)[^8]. The essence of spirit is to become fully self-conscious of itself, such as to realize oneself and to become fully free[^9][^10]. Hegel then argues that the history of the world is a dynamic process that consists in the progressive self-conscientization of the world spirit such that “_it can conform to its own concept_”[^11]. Importantly, the increase in self-consciousness comes at some cost : “learning and the degeneration or downfall of a nation always go hand in hand”[^12] such that evil events must happen for the world spirit to realize itself. Taking the analogy of the seed used by Hegel, evil is contained in the seed of History as a necessary step to self-realization.

Both theodicies bear similarities. First, the importance of self-realization and the development of its true self is used as a criterion to judge the goodness of a world in Leibniz and as a drive for History in Hegel. Second, both posit the _necessity_ of evil, as being an inherent necessary part of the world. However, in contrast to Leibniz 'approach, Hegel’s account is _dynamic_ and seems to assume the potentiality of an end of History when the world spirit would become fully self-conscious. At this moment, as learning becomes unnecessary, so does evil.
