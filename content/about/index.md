I am a Senior Machine Learning Scientist at Genentech, San Francisco, USA.

My machine learning interests revolve around **time series**, **graphs**, and **geometry** with applications in **biology** and **healthcare**. My main focus relies on developing robust and interpretable methods that can improve the cooperation between humans and AI. I'm studying this interaction from a computational and philosophical perspective.

Before Genentech, I was a postdoctoral associate at Yale University with Smita Krishnaswamy. I received my PhD with the highest honors at KU Leuven, Belgium, under the supervision of Yves Moreau. In the past, I was also a research scientist at MIT (with David Sontag), University of Toronto (with Rahul Krishnan), and at ETH ZÃ¼rich (with Karsten Borgwardt). I have received a the 2024 McKinsey prize for the best PhD thesis, two FWO PhD fellowships, and two mobility grant awards.

I have also held appointments at Google X, Microsoft Research, Janssen pharmaceutica, and Nokia.
